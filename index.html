The initial manga, written and illustrated by Toriyama, was serialized in Weekly Shōnen Jump from 1984 to 1995, with the 519 individual chapters collected into 42 tankōbon volumes by its publisher Shueisha. Dragon Ball was originally inspired by the classical 16th-century Chinese novel Journey to the West, combined with elements of Hong Kong martial arts films. The series follows the adventures of protagonist Son Goku from his childhood through adulthood as he trains in martial arts. He spends his childhood far from civilization until he meets a teen girl named Bulma, who encourages him to join her quest in exploring the world in search of the seven orbs known as the Dragon Balls, which summon a wish-granting dragon when, and battles a wide variety of villains, many of whom also seek the Dragon Balls</p>

                            The manga has become a TV anime in 1973. The first series lasted a half year, but they made another series in 1973 based on a new story called Doraemon Returns. Then another series started in 2005 and it has been continuing ever since.
                            
                            The TV program lasts only 30 minutes, but Fujiko also wrote longer stories for the movies. The first movie ‘Nobita’s Dinosaur’ was made in 1980, and then 40 other movies were made based on long stories</p>
